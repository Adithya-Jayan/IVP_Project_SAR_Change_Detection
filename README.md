# Course Project for EC348 - Image and Video Processing
**SAR Image Change Detection using Frequency Domain Analysis and Logistic Regression**


A modified implementation of the method discussed in ["Synthetic aperture radar image change detection based on frequency domain analysis and random multigraphs"](References/2018_JARS_CD_FDA_RMG.pdf)

The project implements Multitemporal SAR image difference detection using Frequency domain based Saliency analysis to provide Coarse change detection followed by Logistic regression for fine changes.

- The Final code can be found in the [Python Notebook](IVP_Project_Final.ipynb).
- Please refer to our [project report](Submission_Report/Change_Detection_for_MultiTemporal_SAR_Images.pdf) for more details on the method and implementation.
